# Scripts

I occasinally script things to make my life easier, and I'll add them here if they may be of use to others. All of these work on my windows 10 machine, no idea if they will work elsewhere. 

##panel.py
[Flemmeng Frandsen](https://gitlab.com/dren.dk/kicad-util) makes a great KiCad panelisation tool, however I use it so infrequently I keep forgetting the command to call it. As such I made a script to prompt me for the required values along with calling his tool. Requires kicad-util to be installed and for the path to the .jar file to be hardcoded into the script.
